# CoronaExchange

This app allows people to find items they need urgently (and cannot buy, as they are currently sold out) and trade for them with items they have too much of.

## Use cases

### Trade items

A simple example:

Mr. Brown freaked out, when he heard of the outbreak of a new disease. He ran to the store and bought tons of toilet paper. But in his urgency he forgot to buy noodles.

Mrs. Green meanwhile could not get any toilet paper, but bought a bunch of noodle packs. She calls up the CoronaExchange app and adds noodles to her stock, stating that she's willing to trade for toilet paper.

Mr. Brown opens up his app and can quickly check that someone close to him (Mrs. Green) is offering noodles for toilet paper. He clicks the trade offer and negotiates a meeting, where they can safely exchange a set amount of their items.
